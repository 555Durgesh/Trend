# Trend Teller (Round-1)


### Details
The project began with setting up a bottom navigation bar to split the app into two sections: one for all news and another for development steps. I used a more efficient method for API calls to retrieve JSON responses, which were then parsed into ArticleItem objects and displayed using a RecyclerView. Firebase Cloud Messaging was integrated for notifications, with support for data payloads. Clicking on a headline opened the corresponding article in a browser window.
